"Taking care of your customers is easy: all you have to do is drag them to the appropriate shop.",
"Once placed in one of the shops, tap the customer to begin serving them.",
"Don't let your customers stay unattended for too long or they will become angry and leave!",
"Act quickly! Some customers purchase more items than others so they may need to be directed to another shop.",
"When the customers are done shopping, they will line up at the cashier to pay. Tap on the customer to get your money!",
"This is where your money and customer happiness are displayed. When a customer leaves because they feel they've been waiting too long, your happiness level will drop and you won't get paid.",
"Money is very important to keep your mall running. Use it efficiently to hire more staff members, open new shops, or upgrade current ones.",
"After the shop is closed at the end of a day, you can start making upgrades and hiring to prepare yourself for the next day.",
"This shows how many days your mall has been open. Each day lasts about 2.5 minutes.",
"This is your shop level. Tapping this will display the day's earnings and changes to the happiness meter. It will also show you the requirements for the next level.",
"If you play long enough and do a good job of making your customers happy, a special guest might visit your mall to shop there. Good luck! "
