either VEPs (very evil person) or EVIPs (evil very important person)
EVIPs/VEPs (evil vips are bad customers that make your life harder (not sure about this idea)):

the puppet: walks past the cashier and puts himself on the wall, now you have to wind up a music box
creeper: will blow up if close to people, try to place it as far as possible until calm
sephiroth: cuts the mall in half
purple guy: kills a customer
nega pinky: follows employees around and gets them if they stand still too long
goopy gamer: leaves piles of goop behind that slows employees and speeds up customers
mr beast: tries to help customers before your employees do and if he does he gives them your money
