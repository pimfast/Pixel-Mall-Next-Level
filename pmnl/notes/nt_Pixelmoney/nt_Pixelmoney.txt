Due to conflicts between how the OG game was designed and how I am legally allowed to distribute games,
I have to re-think the pixelmoney system. What I would like to do is keep the pixelmoney system,
but just come up with new ways of acquiring pixelmoney.
Ideas are as follows:


Ads:
  each ad is between 15-30 seconds and is not an actual ad for anything
  
  black and white lame product commercial
  low quality mobile game ad
  ad for old cellphones that are able to run pixel mall
  
  (regional ad depending on your location/timezone?)
  United States:
  idk
  Netherlands:
  windmill upkeep
  Thailand:
  get a temple


Minigames:
  minigames are short and aren't replayable


Tycoon:
  pvz zen garden/candy box 2 style side-tycoon that earns you pixelmoney without any input


Upgrades:
  upgrade the counter to earn a small amount of pixelmoney with each successfully serviced customer
