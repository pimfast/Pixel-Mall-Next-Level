so on the main menu there'll be a button to the side that says "Login"
unless you're already logged in which case it'll say "Account" and above that it
says in little black text "Logged in as: >your name<"

if you tap on login it will have two text boxes for filling in your username and password and beside that
two more text boxes and uhhh register ehhh login/register ahhhh

anyway you press on account and opens up a window,
in the center left-ish maybe top-ish or just center it has your character doing 
one of their animations (if they have one) and every 3 seconds it changes to another
animation (if they have one)
if you haven't designed a character yet it just appears as a checkerboard pattern

anyway next to that thing is your name


also:
friends list
delete account
beside your username it has a little pencil button that lets you rename
log out
oh yeah and design customer
