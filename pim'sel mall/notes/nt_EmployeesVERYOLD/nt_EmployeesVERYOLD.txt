SWEET IDEA!!! max level employees can be toggled to enable or disable their helpful mode
when in helping mode or whatever they will *not listen to orders*
they will instead pick the first customer available and personally walk them to their desired store
and then stay at the store with them until you tap the store to begin servicing the customer
the customer moves on to the checkout and the employee moves on to help the next customer
maybe help-mode employees will be at half-alpha during the day and show an icon at night to avoid confusion
oh also this probably won't be an issue but just in case:
you can't start the day without at least one non-helpful-mode employee

no... that's not a sweet idea. while it would make it easier for the user to not have to drag the
customers anymore, doing so would ruin the picture-match gameplay that is at the core of the game loop
all you would be doing at high levels of the game would be tapping ! bubbles. and that SUCKS and is BORING!
i'm sure there's some way to scale it up even with a hundred employees but that there is not it

Employees:

pal: a yellow rabbit
gal: an green rabbit
fellow/chap: a light-blue butler rabbit wid a mustache
squirt: a red gen z-er rabbit (seems kinda indistinct, maybe not this one)
champ: a purple rotund rabbit
homie: a pink nerdy rabbit with big glasses
amigo: a orange gruff rabbit with an afro
buddy: a blue rabbi rabbit with little glasses
(a lot of the names above aren't even synonyms for friend! what happened?)
actually one of them should be a dog specifically a basset hound

Secret/unlockable:
gustavo fring: gus fring the human from breaking bad
fella: a gangster rabbit
comrade: a goth rabbit
chum: a fish rabbit
pal nega: a shadow version of pal
chunky boy: big chungus
companion: anxious rabbit 0,_ ‚πÅ0
mate: romantic rabbit
associate: elite big-time rabbit with white-out glasses
compadre: cowboy rabbit with a cowboy hat

Seasonal (idk about this idea tbh (maybe just be skins for existing characters?)):
(play during halloween) zombunny
(play during easter) easter bunny
(play during christmas) elf-rabbit
(play during sinterklaas) a non-racist peter-rabbit
(play during peter rabbit's release anniversary) actual peter rabbit
(play during this game's anniversary) pinata pal

If the employees were to have unique abilities (which they might i think it's kinda cool):
polish ability that increases a shop's value/rating the longer this employee stays there (resets when they leave)
jump ability that lets the employee jump a floor if the selected store is on the floor right above or below
drag.. something with being able to drag this employee specifically... maybe a teleport or something or not
parrot ability that automatically carries the customer to where they need to go after done serving them
speed ability when you hold down the employee for 1 second it will run super fast to the next store you tap
swagger ability that gives the employee a permanent aura that speeds up employees in it's radius
gun ability that lets you kill a customer.							i mean put them to sleep for 5 seconds
mind control ability that makes it so customers they're serving (in stores) don't leave until you let them
mind reading ability if this employee is working the counter then all new customers coming from there will show their desired store even before they get to the elevator
money bags ability that gives lotsa money for serving a customer but also takes forever to do it
