4v4 gamemode where each player controls a single employee. like puyo puyo tetris style but with more players

3v3, 2v2, and 1v1 are also valid but if teams are uneven then you get paired with a bot

try to earn the most money/ratings before time runs out!

counter has a burnout mechanic where if you stay to long you get tired and you can't serve/serve slower

cannons on the top of the level? slow aiming but if you do it right you can hit an enemy and slow them!

can steal customers? send bad customers to the enemy?

players can spend time advertising with a sign and dancing the better your dance is the more customers you get?

setup screen lets you choose how many tall the mall is
it takes the lowest level player and allows taller malls depending on if they reached the required level

example:
if the highest level player in the lobby is 53,
and the lowest level player is 24,
then the match level is set to 30
and the height is limited to 3 screens tall
(1-10 is one screen, 11-20 two screens, 21-30 three screens, etc.)

there are never any locked stores, as every store within the playable space is level 1
