4v4 gamemode where each player controls a single employee. like puyo puyo tetris vibe but with more players

3v3, 2v2, and 1v1 are also valid but if teams are uneven then you get paired with a bot(?)

only difference between players is some might have access to alternate skins.

receive money & ratings from every customer served (like normal):
	use money received to upgrade shops
	you can upgrade an advertisement in the lobby to get customers more often (multiplayer exclusive)
	you can only upgrade a shop if your player is standing on it (also gotta have enough money ofc)
	
	ratings are used to decide the winner when the timer runs out
	whichever team has the most by then wins!

counter maybe has a burnout mechanic where if you stay too long you get tired and you can't serve/serve slower

cannons on the top of the level? slow aiming but if you do it right you can hit an enemy and stun them!

can steal customers? send bad customers to the enemy?

setup screen lets you choose how many tall the mall is. going up/down by 10. so min is 10, next is 20, etc.
max level determined by taking the lowest level player's current level and rounding down to the nearest 10
example:
if the highest level player in the lobby is 53,
and the lowest level player is 24,
then the match level is set to 20
and the height is limited to 2 screens tall
(1-10 is one screen, 11-20 two screens, 21-30 three screens, etc.)

only employees that are within the screen limit are selectable.
so none of the rat characters can be chosen if the game is level 40, even if everyone has reached max level.

there are never any locked stores, as every store within the playable space starts at level 1
