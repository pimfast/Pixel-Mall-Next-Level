Special stores:
restaurant (the customer sits. after some time they are ready to order, after more time they are done.)
cons: we need to make a sit sprite for every customer  pros: we can use that for seating in the lobby too

museum (the customer just walks around here for a bit. can handle multiple customers)
cons: boring if it's the end of the day and the player is waiting for the customer to leave  pros: pretty cool

this isn't a store but when the mall gets taller you could add a metro platform for more customers
cons: it might not be possible for the player to handle more customers  pros: more customers

indoor playground (upgraded versions give better ratings but the pay is always 0)
