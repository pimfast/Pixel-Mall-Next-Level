SWEET IDEA!!! max level employees can be toggled to enable or disable their helpful mode
when in helping mode or whatever they will *not listen to orders*
they will instead pick the first customer available and personally walk them to their desired store
and then stay at the store with them until you tap the store to begin servicing the customer
the customer moves on to the checkout and the employee moves on to help the next customer
maybe help-mode employees will be at half-alpha during the day and show an icon at night to avoid confusion
oh also this probably won't be an issue but just in case:
you can't start the day without at least one non-helpful-mode employee
