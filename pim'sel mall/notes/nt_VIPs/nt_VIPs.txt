EVIPs/VEPs (evil vips are bad customers that make your life harder (not sure about this idea)):

the puppet: walks past the cashier and puts himself on the wall, now you have to wind up a music box
creeper: will blow up if close to people, put them as far as possible until they calm down
sephiroth: cuts the mall in half
purple guy: kills a customer
butter monster: leaves puddles of buddah that speeds up customers standing in it
nega pal: follows employees around and gets them if they stand still too long
slime monster: leaves puddles of slime that slows employees walking through it
